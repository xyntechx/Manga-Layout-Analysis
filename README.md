# Manga Layout Analysis
This repository holds my work for the **Manga Layout Analysis via Deep Learning (SCSE01)** research project under the 2021 Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) by Nanyang Technological University.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism
As of now, `Manga Layout Analysis.ipynb`:
- performs Instance Segmentation on manga pages to identify frames (panels), faces, and text (speech bubbles),
- associates faces to text, and
- determines the order of text.

`Manga OCR.ipynb` builds a Japanese Hiragana and Kanji Optical Character Recognition model using the Kuzushiji-49 and Kuzushiji-Kanji datasets.

## üéØ Overarching Aim
Overall, this research project aims to lay the foundation for easy translation and adaptation of manga into movie scripts, novels, and other literature pieces.
