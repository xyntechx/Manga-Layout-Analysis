# Manga Layout Analysis
This research project for the 2021 Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) by Nanyang Technological University aims to segment character faces and speech bubbles of manga pages, associating each character face to the speech bubble of said character based on the distance between the two classes. In doing so, the project hopes to lay the foundation for easy translation and adaptation of manga into movie scripts, novels, and other literature pieces.
