# Manga Layout Analysis
This repository holds my work for the **Document Layout Analysis via Machine Learning (SCSE01)** research project under the 2021 Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) by Nanyang Technological University.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism
As of now, `Manga Layout Analysis.ipynb`:
- performs Instance Segmentation on manga pages to identify frames (panels), faces, and text (speech bubbles)
- associates faces to text
- determines the order of text

## üéØ Overarching Aim
Overall, this research project aims to lay the foundation for easy translation and adaptation of manga into movie scripts, novels, and other literature pieces.
